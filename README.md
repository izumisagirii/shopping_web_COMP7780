# shoppingweb 7780
The sample code is fuckingly difficult to read and maintain. I rewrote it using the separation of front and back ends.

## Highlights
- **Backend Refactoring**: Achieved a clean separation of concerns by refactoring the backend, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
- **Frontend Construction**: Utilized **Vue.js** to build a dynamic and robust frontend.
- **Responsive UI**: Integrated **Bootstrap** to create a responsive user interface that adapts seamlessly to both mobile and desktop devices.

## Prerequisites
- **MySQL Service**: Ensure that the MySQL service is running before initiating the project. Meet these conditions and preload the database.
```json
{
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'user99',
    password: 'user99',
    database: 'comp7780'
}
```
- **Node.js Environment**: A Node.js environment is required to run the server-side components.

## Project Setup

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

```sh
cd ./shoppingwebvue
npm install
npm start
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies and start the development server and back-end server for the ShoppingWeb application.
